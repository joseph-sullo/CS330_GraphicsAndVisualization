How do I approach designing software?

  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

    One of my most improved skills throughout the course is creating colors through RGB values. I'm much more comfortable
    with how the various shades blend together to give me the colors I want.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?

    I followed a very trial and error based design process, trying multiple values for things such as scale, rotation, and positioning
    to finally land on the perfect setup.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    Having the ability to try things and not be afraid of failure is an important skill that I can bring to any future work or projects.


How do I approach developing programs?

  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
     
      While I've been building up the strategy since first starting my degree, the assignments and milestones used in this course
      really helped to cement the use of methods and calls to create modular, object based code structure.
      
  How did iteration factor into your development?

      Using iteration was crutial to my programming development. Many of my objects used the same shapes, and some more than once.
      Iterating them multiple times without having to code each individual one saved hundreds of lines of code.
      
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

    I find I've become more confident with using the code of OpenGL throughout the milestones. I spent less time on the planning
    and drafting stages and more time diving into the code itself to make real changes, see how they affected the scene, and adjust
    accordingly.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

      The use of functions and modular coding will help throughout my academic career. 
      
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

      Likewise, modular coding will make me a better developer in a professional setting. The problem solving, time management, and working under
      pressure will also prove invaluable.
